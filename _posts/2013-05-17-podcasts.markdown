summary: Some musings on the podcasts I enjoy, and how I listen to them
---

Although I've been listening to podcasts for a while, I've recently started listening
to them a lot more.  This has indirectly been caused by Google's retirement of Google
Reader.  In the good old days of Reader, I would manage my podcasts using a Google-made
Android app called Listen.  Listen would integrate with Google Reader to manage your
subscriptions, which made life super easy in synchronising listening between different
devices.  But sans Reader, I've had to look for other options.  After a few misses,
I stumbled upon [BeyondPod](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mobi.beyondpod).
It's a great little podcast manager, with some advanced features for power-users and a high
level of customisability (is that a word??).

It was fairly easy to import my existing subscriptions across from Google Reader (well, 
[Feedly]({% post_url 2013-03-22-feedly %}) now), and also has good search features to add
new feeds.

So, without further ado, I'm listening to:

 * [Click](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/n13xtmd5) - A weekly show on the BBC World Service about the weekly tech news.
 It's a bit more "user-friendly" than other shows, but provides a good round up.

 * [Comedy of the Week](http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/comedy) - The comedy of the week from BBC Radio 4, usually makes
 me look a bit of an idiot grinning mid-commute...

 * [Execute Podcast](http://theindustry.cc/category/podcast/) - Interview show featuring people who make things (mostly 
 for the web).  Really Inspiring.

 * [Friday Night Comedy from BBC Radio 4](http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/fricomedy) - Another grin-inducer.  Depending on 
 what is on air, usually either The Now Show or the The News Quiz.

 * [Happy Monday Podcast](http://happymondaypodcast.com) - A (relatively) short weekly interview show with web-folk.
 Probably has the best theme tune in this list.

* [In Our Time](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qykl) - Melvyn Bragg discusess a subject (could be anything!) with 
experts in the field.

* [The Media Show](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00dv9hq) - Another from BBC Radio 4, weekly show covering the issues
affecting todays media landscape.

* [Science Weekly](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/series/science) - Science news show from The Guardian, featuring news, features 
interviews.

* [ShopTalk](http://shoptalkshow.com) - Sound effects podcast about front-end web development.

* [Tech Weekly](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/series/techweekly) - Like Science Weekly, but for Tech news. Not as good as it was...

* [The Big Web Show](http://5by5.tv/bigwebshow) - "It's everything web that matters", and it's presented by 
Jeffery Zeldman.

* [The East Wing](http://theeastwing.net) - Another web design/development/stuff show, but no worse for it :)

* [The Frequency](http://5by5.tv/frequency) - A weekly news show covering web stuff and real world things that matter.

* [The Infinite Monkey Cage](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00snr0w) - Prof Brian Cox and Robin Ince + guests use science to
make the World right again.

* [The Life Scientific](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b015sqc7) - A look back at the life and career of a scientist leading their
field.  Fascinating.

* [The Non Breaking Space Show](http://nonbreakingspace.tv/) - An interview show, talking to major players in the
web dev & design spheres.

* [The Web Ahead](http://5by5.tv/webahead) - Jen Simmons discusses the new technologies and methodologies
available to web designers and developers with a guest or two.

* [Unfinished Business](http://unfinished.bz/) - A weekly discussion show about the business end, the sharp end of web, 
design and creative industries.  With jokes.

* [Upfront Podcast](http://upfrontpodcast.com/) - An in-depth discussion on the latest tooling, workflow and best practices for 
front-end developers.  One of the few tech shows that doesn't seem to worry about Photoshop.
