## Web Haiku

So I've decided to write (roughly) a haiku a week, with a general theme of web development stuff - seeing as that's what I do all the time anyway... (web dev, not haikus).

Seeing as I'm writing javascript at the moment, I thought that would be a good starting point.

So here goes:

> typeof undefined
cannot read the property
ReferenceError
