  <p>I LOVE Google Reader.</p>

<p>Or should that be LOVED Google Reader.</p>

<p>When I heard the news that Google was closing the cornerstone of pretty much every lunchtime for the last few years, I was pretty annoyed. I know it was on the cards for a while, I know that maintaining and supporting Reader didn&#8217;t make commercial sense, and yet I still felt slightly betrayed. Google Reader was the first Google side-product I really used in anger, and was probably the launchpad into my current mostly-google-centered-web-life. I had spent years cultivating feeds, and would automatically open it when I got back to my desk after getting lunch. It was my way of easing myself into the afternoon.</p>

<p>But still, musn&#8217;t grumble&#8230;</p>

<p>That feeling of betrayal didn&#8217;t last long, I opened up Google Reader one last time, scanned my feeds for some articles about the shut down (there were lots&#8230;) and read the ones that suggested alternatives. I opened up a couple and had a look, and it was <a href='http://feedly.com/'>feedly</a> that caught my eye.</p>

<p>It has a nice simple, yet customisable (well, themes) design, allowed me to seemlessly pull over all my Google Reader feeds and keep their categorisations etc, and even has similar keyboard shortcuts. Within a minute or so, I was reading my &#8216;favourites&#8217; feed as normal. Admittedly I did have to make a few changes to the default settings to get things as I wanted - I disabled the stupid &#8220;magazine&#8221; style of reading feeds, set the feeds to be oldest first &amp; unread only, and changed the colour scheme to something slightly more palatable, but it was a straightforward process.</p>

<p>The only real annoyance is the insistence of installing browser plugins, but everybody makes mistakes&#8230;</p>
