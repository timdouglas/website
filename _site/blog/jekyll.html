    Thoughts about jekyll
  </p>

<article class="post">
  <p>Turns out I quite like Jeykll, despite my reservations about having to learn a templating syntax, and having to run a ruby server in development (I don&#8217;t run ruby in deployment, just copy out the generated files). It&#8217;s actually a fairly straightforward process to creating a site as it turns out. Just install the gem, configure your environment, make a couple of template files, write a few posts and bang! You have a fairly simple blog &amp; website.</p>

<p>I quite like being able to write posts in markdown, much more lightweight than using a fully-fledged CMS like wordpress. Don&#8217;t get me wrong wordpress has its place, but just seems a bit cumbersome for something as simple as this site.</p>

<p>Hopefully the ease of blogging will be enough to make me start blogging again, but who knows&#8230;</p>
