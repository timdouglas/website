  <h1>About Me</h1>
</header>
<section>
  <p>I am a {{ 'now' | date: "%Y" | minus: 1988 }} year-old web developer living in Bristol, UK.  I work for <a href="http://actual-experience.com/">Actual Experience</a> in Bath, mainly on front-end stuff using a heady mix of HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript plus a generous sprinkling of PHP, bash scripting and other bits and pieces.  I've also written an Android app for Actual Experience, <a href="http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ae.agent">download it if you like</a></p>
  <p>I am a big rugby fan, although I no longer play, I watch as much as I can.</p>
  <p>I should probably write some more here, but I can't think of anything at the moment.</p>
  <p>Anyways, here are some photos I took:</p>
