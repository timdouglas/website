  <p>The following are the projects I currently have stored on <a href="http://github.com/timdouglas/">GitHub</a>.  Some are more active than others, and some are forks of other peoples code that I've modified to suit my own needs, fixed issues or simply just had a play with.  One such project is the jQuery GitHub plugin which I modified to display all of my repositories automatically, rather than specifying a list.</p>
